#TO-DO

- One should be able to set "drag" and "drop" to elements separately: 
that the drag elements are not bound to the drop elements &
that they both have a separate drop callback but can also work together.
(dropzone centered vs dragelement centered)
OR by providing .classnames so that dropZones are not fix once set

- One should be able to drop an element 'approximatively' into a smaller one (over 50% of dropzone is covered by dragelement)

- Accessible dragNdrop
